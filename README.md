# Rijan Adhikari — Portfolio

A static, no-build-step portfolio site. Plain HTML/CSS/JS, GSAP for scroll
animation, Three.js for the hero 3D visual. No framework, no bundler, no
`npm install` required.

## Run it locally

Because the JS uses relative `<script>`/`<link>` tags (not ES modules),
you can usually just double-click `index.html` to open it directly in a
browser. If your browser blocks anything when opened via `file://`, run
a tiny local server instead from this folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Editing your content

Everything personal — name, bio, skills, projects, certifications,
socials, timeline — lives in **`data.js`**. Edit that one file and
the whole site updates; you should not need to touch HTML/CSS for
routine content changes.

## Adding your photo

Drop your photo into `public/images/profile/` as `profile.jpg`. See
that folder's README for details. Project screenshots and certificate
images go in their own subfolders under `public/images/` the same way.

  sections.css       hero/about/skills/projects/etc. specific styles
  animations.css     keyframes, reveal base states
  responsive.css     breakpoint fine-tuning
data.js              <- edit this for content changes
js/
  theme.js           dark/light toggle

  three-scene.js      hero 3D cyber core (Three.js)
  constellation.js    skills canvas visualization
  projects.js          project grid + filtering
  github.js             live GitHub repo fetch w/ fallback
  contact.js             front-end form validation
  reveal.js               GSAP ScrollTrigger reveals
  tilt.js                  3D card tilt on hover
  easter-eggs.js            Konami code, hidden terminal, console msg
  main.js                    renders data-driven sections from data.js
public/images/               profile / projects / certificates / gallery
```

## Known gaps to fill in

- **Contact form** validates on the front end but is not wired to a
  backend or email service yet. Connect it to something like Formspree,
  Resend, or a small serverless function, then replace the block marked
  with a comment in `js/contact.js`.
- **Facebook / Instagram URLs** are blank placeholders in `data.js`
  (`social.facebook`, `social.instagram`) — add them when ready; the
  contact section only shows links that are filled in.
- **Certification details** (credential IDs, dates, exact course names)
  are placeholders in `js/data.js` — fill in once you have them.
- **Project links** (GitHub repos, live URLs) are blank per project in
  `js/data.js` — add as you publish them.

## Easter eggs

- Press `` ` `` (backtick) to open a hidden terminal. Try `help`.
- Konami code (`↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → b a`) unlocks a small surprise.
- Check the browser dev console.

## Accessibility & performance notes

- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` — heavy animation, particle motion,
  and the custom cursor are disabled/simplified automatically.
- Custom cursor and card tilt are disabled on touch/coarse-pointer
  devices.
- Particle count and pixel ratio scale down on small viewports.
- Skip link, visible focus states, semantic headings, and ARIA labels
  are in place — re-check with a screen reader before shipping.
